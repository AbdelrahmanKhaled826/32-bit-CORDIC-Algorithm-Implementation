## üß† Overview

The **CORDIC algorithm** is widely used for computing trigonometric, hyperbolic, and vector functions using only **shift-add operations**, eliminating the need for multipliers.  
This makes it ideal for FPGA and ASIC implementations where area and power efficiency are critical.

This project demonstrates:
- Fixed-point arithmetic modeling in MATLAB  
- RTL design in Verilog HDL  
- Co-simulation and accuracy comparison  
- Pipelined architecture for high throughput

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

The CORDIC algorithm iteratively rotates a vector in 2D space using the following equations:
> ### CORDIC Core Equations
> The iterative updates are defined as:
>
> $$
> x_{i+1} = x_i + d_i \, y_i \, 2^{-i}
> $$
> $$
> y_{i+1} = y_i - d_i \, x_i \, 2^{-i}
> $$
> $$
> z_{i+1} = z_i + d_i \, \tan^{-1}(2^{-i})
> $$
>
> where:
> - $d_i = \text{sign}(z_i)$  
> - $(x_0, y_0)$ is the initial vector  
> - $z_0$ is the input angle

The scaling factor $K_n$ after $n$ iterations is given by:

$$
K_n = \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + 2^{-2i}}}
$$

For large $n$, $K_n \approx 0.6073$.



üí° *These equations allow CORDIC to compute trigonometric, vectoring, and rotation operations efficiently using only shift and add operations ‚Äî no multipliers required.*

## üíª Implementation Details

### üîπ MATLAB Fixed-Point Modeling
- MATLAB scripts were used to analyze **quantization error** and determine the optimal word and fraction lengths.
- Fixed-point testbench compared expected vs. simulated values for all modes.
- To achieve the desired precision in CORDIC computations, a MATLAB simulation was performed with up to 30 iterations. The error at each step was compared against a tolerance level of 1e-4.
The results showed that increasing the number of iterations reduces the residual error; however, beyond a certain point, improvements become negligible due to fixed-point resolution limits.

‚úÖ Result: Optimal iteration count = 13

-Through MATLAB simulation and systematic testing, the fixed-point parameters for the CORDIC design were optimized to balance accuracy and hardware efficiency.
After evaluating multiple Word Length (WL) and Fraction Length (FL) combinations, the configuration of WL = 32 and FL = 22 was identified as the best trade-off, ensuring the maximum quantization error remained below 1√ó10‚Åª‚Å∑.

### üîπ Verilog HDL Design
- RTL implemented with **parameterized generics** for iteration and word length.
- Fully **pipelined architecture** for maximum throughput.
- Testbench reads MATLAB-generated inputs and compares RTL outputs in real-time.

Example top-level module:
```verilog
module cordic #(
  parameter ITERATION = 13,
  parameter WORD_LENGTH = 32,
  parameter FRACTION_LENGTH = 22,
  parameter MUL_LENGTH = 64
)(
  input                                 i_cordic_clk,
  input                                 i_cordic_rst_n,
  input               [1:0]             i_cordic_mode,
  input      signed   [WORD_LENGTH-1:0] i_cordic_x,
  input      signed   [WORD_LENGTH-1:0] i_cordic_y,
  input      signed   [WORD_LENGTH-1:0] i_cordic_theta,
  output reg signed   [WORD_LENGTH-1:0] o_codic_out1,
  output reg signed   [WORD_LENGTH-1:0] o_codic_out2
);
```

## üîπ Verification Setup
- MATLAB was used to generate **golden reference data** for all test cases (magnitude, angle, sine, cosine, and rotation).
- The RTL implementation was tested using a dedicated **testbench** (`cordic_tb.v`), which automatically compares RTL outputs with MATLAB reference results.
- All tests were performed using:
  - **13 pipeline stages** (iterations)
  - **Word Length (WL) = 32 bits**
  - **Fraction Length (FL) = 22 bits**

###  ‚úÖSimulation Results
All test cases demonstrated **excellent agreement** between MATLAB and RTL outputs.  
The **maximum relative error** across all tests remained **below 0.001%**, confirming the numerical precision of the design.
